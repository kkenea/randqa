    """
    SP 800-90B Repetition Count Test (RCT) for a binary stream.

    Fails if any run of identical bits reaches/exceeds cutoff.

    Returns a dict:
      {
        "pass": bool | None,   # None when no data (test not run)
        "max_run": int,        # longest observed run length
        "cutoff": int,         # threshold used
        "approx_p": float|None,# very loose upper bound on false alarm prob ~ n * 2^(1 - cutoff)
        "n": int,              # number of bits inspected
        "reason": str          # present only when pass is None
      }

    Notes:
    - For empty input (n == 0), returns pass=None (NOT RUN) to avoid
      misclassifying a missing stream as a failure.
    - approx_p is an order-of-magnitude heuristic (not exact).
